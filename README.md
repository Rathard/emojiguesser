EmojiGuesser is a simple and silly fun game where you are tasked with guessing the name of an emoji or which emoji represents a certain word.

<h2 align=center>Features:</h2>

- A sleek and simple UI design that's inspired by the iconic emoji graphic design, leading to a unique look and a user friendly experience
- ***Two entirely different game modes that test your emoji knowledge!***
  - **Guess by emoji**: You'll get one random emoji name and 4 different emojis, guess which emoji is the right one and represents the given name!
  - **Guess by name**: You'll get one random emoji and 4 different emoji names, guess which name is the right one and represents the given emoji!
- All emojis are included! That means over **3,782 possibilities**, do you know them all?
> [!NOTE]
> Certain emojis can display as a combination of two different emojis, flag emojis can be displayed as two letters instead of their emoji and some newer emojis can be missing leading to a blank box being displayed instead. This mostly depends on which browser you are currently using, your mileage may vary.

<h3 align=center>Choose your gamemode</h3>

The game offers two game modes, you either guess which word an emoji is supposed to be or which emoji a word is supposed to be, **guess by emoji** and **guess by name** respectively, choose whichever sounds more fun to you, or try both!

<h3 align=center>Guessing Time: By Emoji</h3>

In this mode you will get one emoji and 4 different words and you need to choose the right word for the emoji, simple, right? For example: 🥐 <-- this is the emoji you are given, and these are your 4 word options: Watermelon, Croissant, Smiling Face with Sunglasses, Wolf. Which one is it? Select your option and pray for the best.
